[Live on GitHub Pages](https://rivicodes.github.io/odin-calculator/) 🚀

_This is The Odin Project's final assignment/project. The goal is to create from zero a calculator capable of computing the basic operations a calculator would do._

_There are extra basic functions like clearing the user's inputs or the results after computing an operation, deleting single digits in the output, and the basic operations with operands._
